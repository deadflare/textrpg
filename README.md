my intention in making this game was to take all the elements that every RPG has, and combine them into one, while being as simple as possible, like no multiplayer, no events, and not 30 different currencies.

I also wanted to expand my knowledge of C++ while doing something fun.

if I finish this probably in a few months, it will be completely foss. plenty of comments to help others trying to make their own game.

I'll be updating the repo periodically as I add more features.
